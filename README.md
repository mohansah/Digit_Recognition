# Digit_Recognition

The goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten digit images.

MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) is the Dataset contains the handwritten digit images.

I used Artifical Neural Network (ANN) for identifying the handwritten digit images.
